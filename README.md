# DigiDier 🐰

A nostalgic front-end recreation of a classic virtual pet website style. This project replicates the colorful, early 2000s aesthetic of browser games (inspired by "WebPet") using modern web technologies.

## 📖 Description

**DigiDier** is a static website that mimics the layout and design of a vintage virtual pet community. It features a custom "sky" gradient background, a retro-style login box, and a classic tabbed navigation structure.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari). No server installation (like Node.js or PHP) is required.

### Installation & Usage

1.  **Download** the project files.
2.  Ensure you have the following two files in the **same folder**:
    * `index.html`
    * `style.css`
3.  **Double-click** `index.html` to open it in your web browser.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Semantic markup for the page structure.
* **CSS3**: Custom styling for the retro gradients, login box, and specific layout tweaks.
* **Bootstrap 5.3**: Used for the responsive grid system, navigation bar, and utility classes (loaded via CDN).

## 📂 Project Structure

```text
/DigiDier-Project
│
├── index.html      # Main HTML file (contains structure and text)
├── style.css       # Custom styles (gradients, fonts, overrides)
└── README.md       # Project documentation

```

## 🎨 Design Features

* **Retro Gradient Background**: A CSS linear-gradient simulating a blue sky (`#4facfe` to `#00f2fe`).
* **Custom Login Box**: A styled floating login component typical of early 2000s portal sites.
* **Bootstrap Integration**: While the design looks retro, the underlying grid is fully responsive and works on mobile devices.
* **Font Choice**: Uses 'Comic Sans MS' for the logo to enhance the playful, nostalgic feel.
